parameters:

services:
    # default configuration for services in *this* file
    _defaults:
        autowire: true      # Automatically injects dependencies in your services.
        autoconfigure: true # Automatically registers your services as commands, event subscribers, etc.

    # makes classes in src/ available to be used as services
    # this creates a service per class whose id is the fully-qualified class name
    App\:
        resource: '../src/'
        exclude:
            - '../src/DependencyInjection/' # Excluding the DependencyInjection folder because it usually contains configuration code.
            - '../src/Entity/'              # Excluding the Entity folder because it's typically used for data mapping.
            - '../src/Kernel.php'           # Excluding Kernel.php, since it's the entry point and not a service.

    # Add any additional service definitions below if explicit configuration is needed.
    # Please note that last definitions always *replace* previous ones.
    
    # Example of an explicit service configuration:
    # App\Service\MyService:
    #     arguments:
    #         $myParameter: '%my_parameter%'
